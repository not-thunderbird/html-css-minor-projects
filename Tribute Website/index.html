                <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam </b>earned the title "Missile Man of India" for his outstanding
                    contributions to India’s missile development and defense technologies. As a leading scientist at
                    DRDO and ISRO, he was the mastermind behind the successful development of Agni and Prithvi missiles,
                    which placed India among the top nations in defense technology. His leadership during the Pokhran-II
                    nuclear tests in 1998 showcased India’s scientific strength to the world. But beyond his scientific
                    genius, Dr. Kalam was a man of simplicity, integrity, and great wisdom. He always believed in the
                    power of dreams, innovation, and education. His speeches, books, and interactions with students
                    continue to ignite young minds across the country. Even after becoming the 11th President of India,
                    he remained connected to the youth, encouraging them to become nation-builders and to never give up
                    on their goals.
